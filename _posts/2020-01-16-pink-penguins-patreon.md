# Pink Penguins is alive & on Patreon!

Hey folks, hishashiburi desu, ne? 

![](/images/fb-banner.png)

I'm just dropping by to let you know that my project [Pink Penguins](https://pinkpenguins.io) is now officially active on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pinkpenguins)!

Never fear, Pink Penguins content will always be 100% free because this project is 100% self-funded. Any donations will help us to remain independent while expanding our outreach while convering travel, hosting, expansion, & production fees, so please give if you can.
