# Be Encouraged or, How to Respond When Your Inner Voice Says You Failed

The first blog of the year is gonna be an emotional rollercoaster, so if that's not your thing I'll sum it up quickly for you:

When you hit a point where you feel like you haven't accomplished anything &/or feel like giving up, remember everything you went through to get to where you are, then compare the hardships of then to now. Chances are, the climb up to where you currently sit was much, much harder than whatever you're facing now, which should automatically establish your ability to crush whatever you're facing now. So wipe your face, dust yourself off, & kick the butt of whatever's in front of you, because the only other option is giving up & that's for suckers. Never give up.

You're probably wondering what inspired this somewhat random outburst. Well, I'm coming off of a cleansing & energizing 6-month sabbatical with an entirely new perspective, thanks to having a long period of true quiet time where I could really reflect on just what the h*ck was going on in my head. 

## Y'see, I'm a high school drop-out.

This was something I was deeply ashamed of, as I'd been hearing that any future for me was limited to baby daddies & fast food work pretty much since puberty, & dropping out felt like taking a huge leap in _that_ direction. For reasons I'm not quite ready to publicly discuss yet, I dropped out of 9th grade because I genuinely did not expect or even intend to live past 21, which, looking back was a terrifying place to be for a 14yr old with wild hormone-clouded judgement by default. TL;dr I kind of miserably floated by until a financial windfall allowed me to start my first business (& buy my first sewing machine), which introduced me to people _with plans_ who inspired me to try again. So I did. I applied to some colleges with a comically bad fashion portfolio & to my absolute shock was accepted to two programs. Five years & almost $200,000 including scholarships later, & I was no longer a hopeless high school drop out. I was a hopeless & jobless bachelaureate.


## Hooray?

I think Post-graduation was the worst event of my entire life. While my portfolio was a tad better than the cartoonish & weirdly proportioned illustrations I started with, a combination of shaky work history & graduating smack-dab in the middle of The Great Recession left virtually no employment opportunities better than... target. Sure, Target eventually & confoundingly grew into what became a life-changing career at Rackspace, but the couple of years transitioning from severely depressed, unemployed designer to slightly less depressed, but gainfully employed sysadmin were _rough_, which, as you can imagine can provoke some regrets.

As I became more established & even appreciated in tech, I spent a lot of time - too much time - beating myself up over what I chose for undergrad. "You should've gone for computer science or engineering! They were in the same damn building!" my inner me would scream. Thinking back on how I scraped by both academically & financially by the skin of my teeth - depending heavily on charity to fill the gaps that selling literally anything of value that I had didn't fully cover, I felt *so* stupid for squandering a huge opportunity to redeem myself, to prove that quitting high school didn’t make me a statistic that so many told me I would be on a freaking _hobby_.

Worst of all, I wasn't even that good at it outside of one or two severely obscure niche skills. My confidence was & still is negatively affected by the fact that I am in I.T. without a degree in I.T., & I was _right there_.


## But you know what? I got the damn degree.

I got the damn degree despite barely having a 9th grade education. Despite the setbacks. Despite the financial hardship. Despite the abuse. Despite the undiagnosed, untreated mental illness poisoning me from the inside. If we're keeping it a buck, despite the talent.

Despite it all, I did it & that counts for a lot. Maybe I would’ve even been able to have a successful career in fashion if I hadn’t graduated during the Great Recession, but then again I can’t imagine myself now fussing over a sewing machine vs. fussing over a computer. So I guess it worked out for the best in the end. 

I’m sharing this not to humble-brag, but to bring to your memory all of the times when it felt like you failed but you actually won. Spoiler alert: If you're still standing, you won. 

After finally starting to see light again after being surrounded by darkness for a very, very long time, I hope that this probably whiny, definitely long-winded self-reflection will help someone who feels like there's no point. It sounds cliche, but you're stronger than you know, & if your inner voice says different it's wrong.
