You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The first blog of the year is gonna be an emotional rollercoaster, so if that’s not your thing I’ll sum it up quickly for you:</p>

<p>When you hit a point where you feel like you haven’t accomplished anything &amp;/or feel like giving up, remember everything you went through to get to where you are, then compare the hardships of then to now. Chances are, the climb up to where you currently sit was much, much harder than whatever you’re facing now, which should automatically establish your ability to crush whatever you’re facing now. So wipe your face, dust yourself off, &amp; kick the butt of whatever’s in front of you, because the only other option is giving up &amp; that’s for suckers. Never give up.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering what inspired this somewhat random outburst. Well, I’m coming off of a cleansing &amp; energizing 6-month sabbatical with an entirely new perspective, thanks to having a long period of true quiet time where I could really reflect on just what the h*ck was going on in my head.</p>

<h2 id="ysee-im-a-high-school-drop-out">Y’see, I’m a high school drop-out.</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zxvoq6t.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>This was something I was deeply ashamed of, as I’d been hearing that any future for me was limited to baby daddies &amp; fast food work pretty much since puberty, &amp; dropping out felt like taking a huge leap in <em>that</em> direction. For reasons I’m not quite ready to publicly discuss yet, I dropped out of 9th grade because I genuinely did not expect or even intend to live past 21, which, looking back was a terrifying place to be for a 14yr old with wild hormone-clouded judgement by default. TL;dr I kind of miserably floated by until a financial windfall allowed me to start my first business (&amp; buy my first sewing machine), which introduced me to people <em>with plans</em> who inspired me to try again. So I did. I applied to some colleges with a comically bad fashion portfolio &amp; to my absolute shock was accepted to two programs. Five years &amp; almost $200,000 including scholarships later, &amp; I was no longer a hopeless high school drop out. I was a hopeless &amp; jobless bachelaureate.</p>

<h2 id="hooray">Hooray?</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FUoqT2.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think Post-graduation was the worst event of my entire life. While my portfolio was a tad better than the cartoonish &amp; weirdly proportioned illustrations I started with, a combination of shaky work history &amp; graduating smack-dab in the middle of The Great Recession left virtually no employment opportunities better than… target. Sure, Target eventually &amp; confoundingly grew into what became a life-changing career at Rackspace, but the couple of years transitioning from severely depressed, unemployed designer to slightly less depressed, but gainfully employed sysadmin were <em>rough</em>, which, as you can imagine can provoke some regrets.</p>

<p>As I became more established &amp; even appreciated in tech, I spent a lot of time - too much time - beating myself up over what I chose for undergrad. “You should’ve gone for computer science or engineering! They were in the same damn building!” my inner me would scream. Thinking back on how I scraped by both academically &amp; financially by the skin of my teeth - depending heavily on charity to fill the gaps that selling literally anything of value that I had didn’t fully cover, I felt <em>so</em> stupid for squandering a huge opportunity to redeem myself, to prove that quitting high school didn’t make me a statistic that so many told me I would be on a freaking <em>hobby</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HctjJLb.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Worst of all, I wasn’t even that good at it outside of one or two severely obscure niche skills. My confidence was &amp; still is negatively affected by the fact that I am in I.T. without a degree in I.T., &amp; I was <em>right there</em>.</p>

<h2 id="but-you-know-what-i-got-the-damn-degree">But you know what? I got the damn degree.</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7MCuYse.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I got the damn degree despite barely having a 9th grade education. Despite the setbacks. Despite the financial hardship. Despite the abuse. Despite the undiagnosed, untreated mental illness poisoning me from the inside. If we’re keeping it a buck, despite the talent.</p>

<p>Despite it all, I did it &amp; that counts for a lot. Maybe I would’ve even been able to have a successful career in fashion if I hadn’t graduated during the Great Recession, but then again I can’t imagine myself now fussing over a sewing machine vs. fussing over a computer. So I guess it worked out for the best in the end.</p>

<p>I’m sharing this not to humble-brag, but to bring to your memory all of the times when it felt like you failed but you actually won. Spoiler alert: If you’re still standing, you won.</p>

<p>After finally starting to see light again after being surrounded by darkness for a very, very long time, I hope that this probably whiny, definitely long-winded self-reflection will help someone who feels like there’s no point. It sounds cliche, but you’re stronger than you know, &amp; if your inner voice says different it’s wrong.</p>

<p>Today marks the end of yet another awesome <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/">OpenStack Summit</a>, this
time held in the gorgeous city of Berlin, Germany. Those of us fortunate
enough to attend were treated to the latest &amp; greatest updates of what’s
happening with OpenStack - with one particularly exciting announcement being
that the next summit is getting a name change! OpenStack Summit is now being
rebranded as the <strong>Open Infrastructure Summit</strong>, colocated with <a href="https://www.openstack.org/ptg/">OpenStack
PTG</a> in Denver, CO from April 29th to May 4th, 2019. This summit also
marked a milestone for me, as I was given opportunity by our awesome OpenStack
community to <strong>successfully</strong> deliver a clean demo on installing <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/openstack/training/course/name/open-shift-on-open-stack">OpenShift on

<p>For those who missed it, you can view the video on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hshndx23oEc">YouTube</a>. Once I’ve
returned to the U.S. &amp; recovered from this heinous jetlag, a new blog will be
uploaded with more details on the demo environment, &amp; how it can be replicated

you may have recently seen a tweet/subtle cry for help where I mentioned being afraid
to leave the house for an event. As mentioned on Twitter, I was ultimately
glad that I went, but getting out the door following <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/">Open Source Summit North
America</a> was much harder than usual.</p>

<p>I’ve made peace with the fact that I’m a true introvert who needs long
“recharge periods” in-between social events, but I was a bit caught off-guard
by my body’s reaction to the idea of being in a room, <em>with people</em> , far away
from the safety of my domicile. It was kind of funny in hindsight – but it
got me thinking about others who face the same struggles when it comes to
social anxiety. Not everyone succeeds at pushing aside that nagging voice in the
back of your head that’s telling you that you’re going to die &amp; your pupper
will starve to death if you leave. Heck, most of the time Nagging Voice wins
if for no other reason than watching another rerun episode of The Simpsons is
more appealing than constantly pondering if people are secretly laughing at
the way I sometimes stutter or my lazy eye (sn: I don’t have a lazy eye). Fortunately for me, I have a wonderful little Pupper companion who quickly &amp; expertly mutes Nagging Voice in situations where he’s allowed. Unfortunately in this specific situation, I couldn’t bring him. Sadly, emotional support animals are not covered under the ADA, even when prescribed by a doctor.</p>

<p>I suppose there’s no real point to this, except to say “I hear you, friend.”
to all of the other Hardcore Introverts out there. Living with anxiety is…
interesting, to say the least.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="trilligansisland" /><category term="socialanxiety" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you follow me on the Twitters (which I certainly hope you do) you may have recently seen a tweet/subtle cry for help where I mentioned being afraid to leave the house for an event.

out a simple, straight-forward way to configure Neutron networks with <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/">PackStack</a> without the need for fiddling with
network namespaces. Well, after trying out virtually every method I finally
got it working how I wanted, &amp; this is how.</p>

<h3 id="environment-setup">Environment Setup</h3>

<p>For my environment, I’m running <a href="https://www.centos.org/download/">CentOS 7.5</a> on an <a href="https://amzn.to/2LFNUIR">Intel i5
NUC</a> with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2LHjCWa">500GB Samsung SSD</a> &amp; <a href="https://amzn.to/2LJz8Bc">16GBx2 RAM</a>. My network name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eno1</code>, &amp; my host IP is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.166</code>. Because I don’t want to have to drop into a network namespace before accessing my instances I will need to configure my Neutron <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> network on this same subnet.</p>

<p>So, because I’m using <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/">PackStack</a> as my deployment tool, I will
need to adjust Neutron settings in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">answers.txt</code> with the following settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=vxlan,flat
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=extnet:br-ex
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES=br-ex:eno1
...
CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO_FLOATRANGE=192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS</code> will ensure that, if needed, I can
configure a “flat” network without tunnels, vlans, etc.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS</code> will create a physical network named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extnet</code> that will be associated with an OVS bridge named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br-ex</code> – all
created by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packstack</code> installer.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES</code> will connect the OVS bridge created in
the previous step - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br-ex</code> - with the host’s public network, which in my
case is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eno1</code></li>
  <li>Now, because I left <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO</code> set to the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=y</code>, I will
have to set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO_FLOATRANGE</code> to match my home network
range, which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.0/24</code>. Adjust this to fit your own network range,
or if you’re feeling fancy you can edit settings in your router to match the
default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">172.24.4.0/24</code> range.</li>
</ul>

<p>After making a few other customizations, such as changing the default
passwords for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">demo</code>, I’m ready to install!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ packstack --answer-file=answers.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once installation completes, I should be able to build a server connected to
the automatically created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code> network, then after attaching a <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/floating-ip.html">floating
IP</a> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Public</code> network I should be able to access the server
without namespaces!</p>

<p>Let’s see if it works:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ openstack server create myserver --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny \
--key-name mykey --nic net-id=d21c5fde-0f9a-46af-9287-b554acca3538 --wait
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ openstack floating ip create public
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ openstack server floating ip associate myserver 192.168.1.10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, moment of truth. Let’s try to login to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myserver</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-`"># ssh cirros@192.168.1.10
$ hostname
myserver
$ exit
Connection to 192.168.1.10 closed.
</code></pre>

<p>SUCCESS! So after an embarrassingly long time spent troubleshooting, testing,
&amp; re-OS-ing I’ve finally solved the problem of simple Provider networks.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="openstack" /><category term="packstack" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those who know me, know that I am 100% an OpenStack Fangirl &amp; will never stop loving the project, but, like a lot of people in the community – I have a love/hate relationship with Neutron that can sometimes be heavy on the hate.
