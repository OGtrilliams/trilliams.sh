        "excerpt":"So for those who saw the OpenStack 8th Birthday Livestream last week, you heard the news that I’ve been (slowly) working towards the coveted RHCA while putting together content for Linux Academy.It was a goal that I expected to achieve last year, but unfortunately for me, God/destiny/Life/the Flying Spaghetti monster/whatever higher power you believe in had different plans for 2017. As I frequently tell my peers &amp; anyone seeking advice on next moves – a setback should never become a stopping point. Unfortunately, a huge part of Adulting is comprised of learning how to navigate over/around/under figurative hurdles that can block us from crossing the finish line. If you’re anything like me, after the 13895y385th hurdle you either get so distracted or so discouraged that you feel like [insert goal] isn’t meant for you, so you give up. Trilligan’s Island If you can’t tell, I hit that point as the original goal date came &amp; went, &amp; I was no closer to having an RHCA certification than I was the day I said I wanted it. Pressure from balancing work, travel, home, &amp; commitments I made in the open source community, combined with disappointment in myself for breaking a promise kind of set me in a spiral of self-pity &amp; apathy that took a while to even recognize. Without getting too personal, I’ll say that the SuperIntrovert™ tendencies that I’d managed to carefully balance well enough to function were rearing their ugly heads again, resulting in a months-long block of unanswered phone calls &amp; emails, &amp; deliberate avoidance of anything social, as isolation is my comfort zone. Isolating myself to Trilligan’s Island only made things worse, as recently I noticed that the apathetic attitude I took towards personal progression had started to creep into job performance. Wuh-oh. This is where it became clear that something had to change, lest I find myself both RHCA-less AND jobless. How to Stop a Ship From Sinking So, after months of just going through the motions, how do you change course before it all blows up in your face? Well the most important thing is to recognize the signs. As one well-versed in The Wrong Thing To Do I can tell you what’s not a great idea:   Don’t isolate yourself  Don’t blame yourself  Don’t blame anyone else  Seriously. Pointing fingers solves nothing &amp; just breeds animosity.  Start again. Just start again.You haven’t truly failed until you stop trying, as cliché as it sounds. A bonus tip I can give you is to find someone (or, something) to hold you accountable on progress that you’ve made towards your goal. And because I’m trying to not be a complete hypocrite for 2018, I’ve decided to use this blog space as a bit of a journal to record my personal warts-n-all (minus any possible NDA violations, of course)  journey to RHCA certification. If that sounds like something you’re into – welcome! If not – well stay anyway because I like you. ","categories": ["jekyll","update","redhat","openstack","rhca"],

        "excerpt":"Those who know me, know that I am 100% an OpenStack Fangirl &amp; will never stoploving the project, but, like a lot of people in the community – I have alove/hate relationship with Neutron that can sometimes be heavy onthe hate. It’s an awesome project created &amp; maintained by some of the most brilliant people I’ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with but OMG Y ARE U SO DIFFICULT. ahem Anyhoo, while preparing architecture for my next course, I spent weeks diggingthrough docs, blogs, video demos &amp; anything else I could find trying to figureout a simple, straight-forward way to configure Neutron networks with PackStack without the need for fiddling withnetwork namespaces. Well, after trying out virtually every method I finallygot it working how I wanted, &amp; this is how. Environment Setup For my environment, I’m running CentOS 7.5 on an Intel i5NUC with a 500GB Samsung SSD &amp; 16GBx2 RAM. My network name is eno1, &amp; my host IP is 192.168.1.166. Because I don’t want to have to drop into a network namespace before accessing my instances I will need to configure my Neutron public network on this same subnet. So, because I’m using PackStack as my deployment tool, I willneed to adjust Neutron settings in answers.txt with the following settings: CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=vxlan,flatCONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=extnet:br-exCONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES=br-ex:eno1...CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO_FLOATRANGE=192.168.1.0/24Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on:   CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS will ensure that, if needed, I canconfigure a “flat” network without tunnels, vlans, etc.  CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS will create a physical network namedextnet that will be associated with an OVS bridge named br-ex – allcreated by the packstack installer.  CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES will connect the OVS bridge created inthe previous step - br-ex - with the host’s public network, which in mycase is eno1  Now, because I left CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO set to the default =y, I willhave to set CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO_FLOATRANGE to match my home networkrange, which is 192.168.1.0/24. Adjust this to fit your own network range,or if you’re feeling fancy you can edit settings in your router to match thedefault 172.24.4.0/24 range.After making a few other customizations, such as changing the defaultpasswords for admin &amp; demo, I’m ready to install! $ packstack --answer-file=answers.txtOnce installation completes, I should be able to build a server connected tothe automatically created Private network, then after attaching a floatingIP from the Public network I should be able to access the serverwithout namespaces! Let’s see if it works: $ openstack server create myserver --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny \\--key-name mykey --nic net-id=d21c5fde-0f9a-46af-9287-b554acca3538 --wait$ openstack floating ip create public$ openstack server floating ip associate myserver 192.168.1.10Alright, moment of truth. Let’s try to login to myserver. # ssh cirros@192.168.1.10$ hostnamemyserver$ exitConnection to 192.168.1.10 closed.SUCCESS! So after an embarrassingly long time spent troubleshooting, testing,&amp; re-OS-ing I’ve finally solved the problem of simple Provider networks. ","categories": ["openstack","packstack"],

        "excerpt":"If you follow me on the Twitters (which I certainly hope you do)you may have recently seen a tweet/subtle cry for help where I mentioned being afraidto leave the house for an event. As mentioned on Twitter, I was ultimatelyglad that I went, but getting out the door following Open Source Summit NorthAmerica was much harder than usual. I’ve made peace with the fact that I’m a true introvert who needs long“recharge periods” in-between social events, but I was a bit caught off-guardby my body’s reaction to the idea of being in a room, with people , far awayfrom the safety of my domicile. It was kind of funny in hindsight – but itgot me thinking about others who face the same struggles when it comes tosocial anxiety. Not everyone succeeds at pushing aside that nagging voice in theback of your head that’s telling you that you’re going to die &amp; your pupperwill starve to death if you leave. Heck, most of the time Nagging Voice winsif for no other reason than watching another rerun episode of The Simpsons ismore appealing than constantly pondering if people are secretly laughing atthe way I sometimes stutter or my lazy eye (sn: I don’t have a lazy eye). Fortunately for me, I have a wonderful little Pupper companion who quickly &amp; expertly mutes Nagging Voice in situations where he’s allowed. Unfortunately in this specific situation, I couldn’t bring him. Sadly, emotional support animals are not covered under the ADA, even when prescribed by a doctor. I suppose there’s no real point to this, except to say “I hear you, friend.”to all of the other Hardcore Introverts out there. Living with anxiety is…interesting, to say the least.

        "excerpt":"Be Encouraged or, How to Respond When Your Inner Voice Says You Failed The first blog of the year is gonna be an emotional rollercoaster, so if that’s not your thing I’ll sum it up quickly for you: When you hit a point where you feel like you haven’t accomplished anything &amp;/or feel like giving up, remember everything you went through to get to where you are, then compare the hardships of then to now. Chances are, the climb up to where you currently sit was much, much harder than whatever you’re facing now, which should automatically establish your ability to crush whatever you’re facing now. So wipe your face, dust yourself off, &amp; kick the butt of whatever’s in front of you, because the only other option is giving up &amp; that’s for suckers. Never give up. You’re probably wondering what inspired this somewhat random outburst. Well, I’m coming off of a cleansing &amp; energizing 6-month sabbatical with an entirely new perspective, thanks to having a long period of true quiet time where I could really reflect on just what the h*ck was going on in my head. Y’see, I’m a high school drop-out.  This was something I was deeply ashamed of, as I’d been hearing that any future for me was limited to baby daddies &amp; fast food work pretty much since puberty, &amp; dropping out felt like taking a huge leap in that direction. For reasons I’m not quite ready to publicly discuss yet, I dropped out of 9th grade because I genuinely did not expect or even intend to live past 21, which, looking back was a terrifying place to be for a 14yr old with wild hormone-clouded judgement by default. TL;dr I kind of miserably floated by until a financial windfall allowed me to start my first business (&amp; buy my first sewing machine), which introduced me to people with plans who inspired me to try again. So I did. I applied to some colleges with a comically bad fashion portfolio &amp; to my absolute shock was accepted to two programs. Five years &amp; almost $200,000 including scholarships later, &amp; I was no longer a hopeless high school drop out. I was a hopeless &amp; jobless bachelaureate. Hooray?  I think Post-graduation was the worst event of my entire life. While my portfolio was a tad better than the cartoonish &amp; weirdly proportioned illustrations I started with, a combination of shaky work history &amp; graduating smack-dab in the middle of The Great Recession left virtually no employment opportunities better than… target. Sure, Target eventually &amp; confoundingly grew into what became a life-changing career at Rackspace, but the couple of years transitioning from severely depressed, unemployed designer to slightly less depressed, but gainfully employed sysadmin were rough, which, as you can imagine can provoke some regrets. As I became more established &amp; even appreciated in tech, I spent a lot of time - too much time - beating myself up over what I chose for undergrad. “You should’ve gone for computer science or engineering! They were in the same damn building!” my inner me would scream. Thinking back on how I scraped by both academically &amp; financially by the skin of my teeth - depending heavily on charity to fill the gaps that selling literally anything of value that I had didn’t fully cover, I felt so stupid for squandering a huge opportunity to redeem myself, to prove that quitting high school didn’t make me a statistic that so many told me I would be on a freaking hobby.  Worst of all, I wasn’t even that good at it outside of one or two severely obscure niche skills. My confidence was &amp; still is negatively affected by the fact that I am in I.T. without a degree in I.T., &amp; I was right there. But you know what? I got the damn degree.  I got the damn degree despite barely having a 9th grade education. Despite the setbacks. Despite the financial hardship. Despite the abuse. Despite the undiagnosed, untreated mental illness poisoning me from the inside. If we’re keeping it a buck, despite the talent. Despite it all, I did it &amp; that counts for a lot. Maybe I would’ve even been able to have a successful career in fashion if I hadn’t graduated during the Great Recession, but then again I can’t imagine myself now fussing over a sewing machine vs. fussing over a computer. So I guess it worked out for the best in the end. I’m sharing this not to humble-brag, but to bring to your memory all of the times when it felt like you failed but you actually won. Spoiler alert: If you’re still standing, you won. After finally starting to see light again after being surrounded by darkness for a very, very long time, I hope that this probably whiny, definitely long-winded self-reflection will help someone who feels like there’s no point. It sounds cliche, but you’re stronger than you know, &amp; if your inner voice says different it’s wrong. If you liked this blog &amp; would like to see more content, consider donating here.

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: def print_hi(name)  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"endprint_hi('Tom')#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk. adding line to end to find this page ","categories": ["jekyll","update"],
